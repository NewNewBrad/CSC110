Its going to be something like:

user input = int(input)

counter = 1  # we have to use 1 because 0 would always return 0

ans= 1 #avoid multiplying by 0

while counter<=input:

    ans*=counter

    counter+= 1

print(ans)

 

Sample input: 3

counter starts at 1;

ans=1*1 = 1;

counter= 1+counter(1) = 2;

counter(2)<=3;True, REPEAT LOOP

ans=1*counter(2)=2

counter=2+1 =3;

counter(3)<=3;True, REPEAT LOOP

ans=2*counter(3)=6

counter3+1 =4;

counter(4)<=3;False, END LOOP

output
