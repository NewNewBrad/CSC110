# A small madlib program, written in python.


#Percy Shelley's "Ozymandias"
#
#I met a traveller from an antique land
#Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
#Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
#Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
#And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
#Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
#Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
#The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:

#And on the pedestal these words appear:
#'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
#Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
#Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
#Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
#The lone and level sands stretch far away
